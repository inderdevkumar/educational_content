1] You must have seen the volume change notification in Ubuntu-Unity - how there is a progress bar which keeps on updating as volume changes(there is only one notification balloon of volume at a time). When you use a bare window-manager you don't get these eye-candies. So I used a patched libnotify to implement a similar volume change notification with a progress bar when I was using compiz as a standalone window-manager. Same for brightness notification.
2] I used a simple for loop script to download all the pictures in a comic book - a simple wget loop - 2 minutes and all the pictures in a folder downloaded automatically.
3] Recently I used 'scrot' a cmd line screenshot manager to make a cron job at 15 seconds interval to spy what a person did on my laptop. I haven't got an opportunity yet to test it - but developing it was fun. I now have my own very basic spying software.

Linux cli tools like find, wget, sed etc. are immensely powerful & feature-rich. Learn them. Consider these -
1] A single command to download all the .pdf files from a course's website(college faculty's) - used wget.
2] A single command to find all the font files from 150+ directories - move them to a new dierctory & copy them to /usr/share/fonts. I needed this recently when I installed google-fonts from Github - used find & xargs.

Beside these there are many more. Check out this website -> http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/spice-up-your-unix-linux-shell-scripts.html

What I want to say is find a problem/repetitive task & implement/automate it using the cli tools & shell scripts. It's fun, you learn a lot, get the job done & can personalize & customize it indefinitely.

=======  2   done ========
Make a bash script that can ping to your local ip address
The result of the ping command should be captured and test for success or failure
SUCCESS - the server name shows in GREEN and display ALIVE (also in GREEN)
FAILURE - the server name shows in RED and display DEAD (also in RED)

1. I like to run git push command automatically just after my machine is restarted
2. I like to have notification in my PC for memory left in my PC amd the specification of sysytem just after restart of my pc.
   Memory left-> If memory is <= 200G message "Delete unwanted files else will create problem in pushing to git" in Red colour
    If >200G but  <=400G show message "Warning " in Yellow colour
    If >400 than show message "No Action required" in Green colour
   RAM Having
   System Model
3. Create Notification of memory used in educational_content folder. It should be less than 80MB. 
    If Greater than 80mb show message "Delete unwanted files else will create problem in pushing to git" in Red colour.
    Also show the files/folders having size greater than 80mb
    If <80mb but greater than 50mb show message "Warning " in Yellow colour
    Also show the files/folders meeting this condition.
    If <50mb than show message "No Action required" in Green colour

================
1. Create a script that will monitor whether apache2 service is on or not. Also first check whether apache2 is installed or not. If not installl than intsll it first than monitor
	if on find its process id
	if off than make it on and find the process id

2. Create a script that will use webpage from https://www.tooplate.com and broadcast its own similar webpage.

Make a note: Both should run on virtual machine and not the local machine(we have m/m issue in localhost)

for apache2:
/var/www/html/index.html

and open broser with ip where apache2 is installed: http://192.168.0.36/
