What is BDD in Python Behave?
Behavior is Driven Development (BDD) is an extension of TDD (Test Driven Development) used for automated browser testing
and framework used is-> PyTest


Test Scenarios In BDD
The main advantage of using BDD is that the language used in writing the test scenarios is simple in nature. 

Scenarios in BDD indicates how a particular feature should behave depending on the input parameters supplied to the test. Irrespective of the BDD test framework being used, the overall format of a feature file still remains the same.


Gherkin, written in simple lang. They can be well understood by technical as well as the non-technical crowd. 

# BDD Scenarios and Feature Files In Gherkin
Scenario: Title/Short Description
    Given [A Precondition]
    When [Some Event]
    Then [Some Outcome]

Suppose, you want to search for LambdaTest on the search engine DuckDuckGo, the test scenario will be,‘Performing search for LambdaTest’ on DuckDuckGo, and the user story will include the ideal usage of Gherkin keywords to achieve the end result.

Feature: LambdaTest search
Scenario: Search for LambdaTest on DuckDuckGo
    Given I am on the DuckDuckGo homepage
    When I enter search term as LambdaTest
    Then Search results for LambdaTest should appear


flow is:

automation test case written in Gharkin-> Python method where actual functionality is coded.
