You can use the following syntax to count NaN values in Pandas DataFrame:

(1) Count NaN values under a single DataFrame column:

df['column name'].isna().sum()

(2) Count NaN values under an entire DataFrame:

df.isna().sum().sum()

The LIMIT clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The LIMIT clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of records can impact performance.
